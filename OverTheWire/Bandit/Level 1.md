# Problem
The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.

# Solution
Run: `ls -alh` to list the file in the current directory.<br>
>-a = list hidden files
>-l = long-list format
>-h = human-readable format

The `readme` file is in the current directory. Run: `cat readme` to view the password for the next level.<br>

# Next level's password
`NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL`
