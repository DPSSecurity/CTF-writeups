# SageCon WGU HTB CTF | String Theory

## Challenge


## Information
Category: Reversing<br>
Difficulty: Easy

## Solution

The title of this challenge gives you a hint towards what you need to do to solve it!<br>

First, we need to unzip the files. Run: `unzip rev_stringtheory`. Then `cd rev_stringtheory`
Run: `strings stringtheory | less` to view the strings inside the program. Piping the output into `less` makes it easier to view. The flag is within the strings!
