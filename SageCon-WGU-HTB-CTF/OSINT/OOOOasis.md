Hey there!

Sorry you missed me. I’m away from responding emails as I am concentrated in finding easter eggs at OASIS.

In the meantime, please take care of the information you share through your email signature as it may leak data or eggs such as "FLAG"

I’ll get back to you as soon as I can.

Thanks!
```
