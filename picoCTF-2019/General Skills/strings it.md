# Problem Description
Can you find the flag in file without running it?

# Solution
Download the file and run `strings <name of file> | grep "picoCTF"` to search through the file for the flag. Using `grep` allows us to search specfically for a text string of `picoCTF`.

# Flag
`picoCTF{5tRIng5_1T_d66c7bb7}`
